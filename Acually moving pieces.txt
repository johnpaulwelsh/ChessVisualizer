Acually moving pieces
-Just subtracting the 2nd value of the Move string from the 4th (e.g. QA4D4, subtracting 100-97=3) and multiplying by the length of a square (20?) and, of course, subtracting the 3rd value from the 5th to get the Z-distance.
-Of course, don't forget to store it in the new index of the array and store 0 or 1 into the old index of the array

Storing pieces
-Make an array with all empty slots being a number (0? 1?) and each chess piece stored at a specific position in the array. To get a position in the array, 8*(ASCII value-96)+Numerical value of square

Castling
-hard-code a case where for pwxyz iff p=K && |x-z|=2, move(w, x, w, z) and move(w, (4.5+1.75*(z-x)), w, (z-x)/2+x)

Collisions
-In theory no pieces should collide unless they are enemies, so auto-removing the piece already in a square in the case of a collision seems like the best answer

Anything else I missed?
